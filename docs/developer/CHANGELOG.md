## [1.0.0] - 2025-07-17

### üéâ Major Release: Anti-Hallucination System & Bielik-11B Unification

#### ‚ú® Added
- **Comprehensive Anti-Hallucination System**
  - Central validation engine (`src/backend/core/anti_hallucination_system.py`)
  - Easy-to-use decorator (`src/backend/core/anti_hallucination_decorator.py`)
  - Configurable validation levels (STRICT, MODERATE, LENIENT)
  - Real-time monitoring and metrics collection
  - Fallback safety mechanisms for reliable responses

- **Unified Bielik-11B Model Usage**
  - All agents now use Bielik-11B exclusively
  - Centralized model configuration in `settings.py`
  - Updated `hybrid_llm_client.py` for unified model selection
  - Updated `model_selector.py` for consistent model usage

- **Enhanced Agent Integration**
  - **ChefAgent**: Full anti-hallucination implementation with ingredient validation
  - **GeneralConversationAgent**: Anti-hallucination protection with response validation
  - **SearchAgent**: Enhanced with anti-hallucination and fact verification
  - **ReceiptAnalysisAgent**: Anti-hallucination validation for OCR results

- **Testing Framework**
  - Comprehensive test suite (`scripts/test_anti_hallucination.py`)
  - Validation testing scripts
  - Performance monitoring
  - Integration tests for all agents

- **Documentation**
  - Complete anti-hallucination system guide (`docs/ANTI_HALLUCINATION_SYSTEM.md`)
  - Implementation summary (`IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`)
  - Updated main README with current features
  - Comprehensive code comments throughout implementation

#### üîß Changed
- **Model Configuration**
  - Unified all agents to use Bielik-11B exclusively
  - Updated `env.dev` with Bielik-11B settings
